1) Need to add rtl-sdr and sox to the Raspian instance
    sudo apt-get rtl-sdr sox

2) I attempted to dockerize this; however, the current approach uses FIFO files which are currently unsupported in Docker.
   Most of the work is done, other than being able to get the data from rtl_fm to the random number generator.

3) The Spring Boot application can start rtl_fm automatically without hearing the radio station being played - which
   is kind of cool.  It would also allow you to change frequencies and the like through curl calls, but alas....

4) To automatically start the random Spring Boot app, add to /etc/rc.local as follows:

    mkfifo /tmp/sdr-random
    /usr/local/bin/rtl_fm -g 50 -f 94.5M -M wfm -s 180k -E deemp | /usr/bin/tee /tmp/sdr-random | /usr/bin/play -q -r 180k -t raw -e s -b
    16 -c 1 -V1 - lowpass 16k &
    /usr/bin/java -jar ~pi/random-0.0.1.jar

The -f is the FM frequency to tune to.  If you don't care about hearing the audo. just mkfifo and java -jar.  If you put the FIFO file not
in /tmp, then it doesn't have to be recreated every time.
